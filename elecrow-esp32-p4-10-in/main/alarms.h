/*
 * Fireside alarms — active-alarm evaluator.
 *
 * Alarms are computed locally from the same MQTT input streams the
 * Headwaters PWA backend consumes (local/spoor/+/inputs,
 * local/picket/+/inputs, local/energy/status.battery_percent), evaluated
 * against a single ESP-owned arm config stored in NVS.
 *
 * Single config (no per-mode profiles) — the user has one arm set that
 * applies. Simpler than the PWA's mode-based scheme because Fireside
 * doesn't need to distinguish driving/camping/storage behavior.
 *
 * Phase 1 (current): plumbing in place. Config empty by default so no
 * alarms fire.
 * Phase 2a: PageAlarms with a battery-alarm switch + threshold.
 * Phase 2b: per-sensor arm rows for Switchback/Picket boards.
 * Phase 3: audible alert on active-alarm rising edge.
